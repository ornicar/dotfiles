# Rules about AI-assisted code contributions

Generated AI code can be accepted, under some conditions:

- Carefully review and understand all the code you submit, and be able to explain it if asked.
- Provide proof of manual testing of the changes, with screenshots or ideally a video.
- Include in the pull-request message, or in commit messages, the prompts you used to generate the code, and the AI tool you used.

# General guidelines for pull requests

- Explain why the change is needed, and what problem it solves.
- Link to any relevant issues or discussions.
- Prefer small, focused pull requests that only change one thing at a time.
- Mark the pull request as a draft if you have not run the code.
- Only mark the pull request as ready when you have confirmed that it works as intended - be on the lookout for edge cases.
- If you're unsure about something, or want to ask if the change is desired before doing the work, ask us in the programming channels on https://discord.gg/lichess
