## Thibs' NixOs config

This is my personal [NixOs](https://nixos.org/) configurations for my machines.
It's not meant to be used by anyone else, but feel free to take inspiration from it.

- `home/` contains my [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) configuration
- `system/` contains my [NixOs](https://nixos.org/) configuration
- `flake.nix` is the entry point from which all machines are configured
- `nvim/` contains my [neovim](https://neovim.io/) configuration
